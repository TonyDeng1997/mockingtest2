Be a better learner (Excerpt of An effective engineer)

# Growth mindset
Your diligence outweigh your intelligence. 
Keep a growth mindset and a learning mindset and be positive.

# Optimize learning

##Learning rate
Your learning rate can grow exponentially. So small deltas
everyday will count.

##Seek work environment conductive to learning
Your working environment can decide your growth and learning. There are six factors
to decide your future job,

 * Fast growth
   ** What is the weekly or monthly growth rate of core business metrics
   ** Are the particular initiatives that you are being working on high priorities,
   		with sufficient support and resources from the company to grow?
   ** How aggressively has the company or team been hiring in the past year? 
   ** How quickly have the strongest team members grown into positions of leadership?
   
 * Training
   Strong onboarding.
 	** is each new person expected to figure things out on his or her own, or
 	is there a more formalized way of onboarding new engineers.
 	
 	** is there formal or informal mentorship?
 	** what steps has the company taken to ensure that team members continue to learn
 	 	and grow
 	** what new things have team members learned recently
 	
 * Openness
    ** do employees know what priorities different teams are working on?
    ** do teams meet to reflect on whether product changes and feature launches
     were worth the effort? Do they conduct post-mortems after outage
     ** how is knowledge documented and shared across the country
     ** what are examples of lessons that the team has learned?
     
 * Pace
 * People
 * Autonomy

## Dedicate time on the job to develop new skills
* Study code for core abstractions written by the best engineers at your company.
* Write more code
* Go through any technical, educational material internally
* Master the programming language that you use
* Send your code reviews to the harshest critics
* Enroll in classes on areas where you want to improve
* Participate in design discussion of projects you are interested in
* Work on diversity of projects
* Make sure you are on a team with at least a few senior engineers whom you can learn from
* Jump fearlessly into code you don't know

## Always be learning
* Learn new programming languages and framework
* Invest in skills that are in high demand
* Attend talks, conferences, and meetups
* Follow bloggers who teach
* Read books
* Join a discussion group
* Build and maintain a strong network of relationships
* Tinker on side projects
* Pursue what you love.

# Prioritize regularly
* Track To-Dos in a single, easily accessible list
* Focus on what directly produces value
* Focus on the important and non-urgent
* Reduce context switches
* Make if-then plans to combat procrastination
* Make prioritization a habit

# Strong Execution
## Move fast
* Be a faster person in doing things

## Invest in time saving tools
Write good tools or install tools to help improving your speed.

## Shorten debugging and validation loops
* File reproducible tickets with minimal steps
* Understand the best way to debug is a large part of development

## Master your programming environment
* Tracking changes in version control
* Compiling or building code
* Profiling product
* Reloading a webpage on a development server with new changes    
* Testing out the behavior of an expression
* Running a unit test or program
* Reformatting code or data in text editor
* Finding the callers of a function
* Rearranging desktop windows
* Navigating to a specific place in a file

### Mastering your IDE
* get proficient with your facoriate text editor in your IDE. Learn
the shortcut keys and combos.

For instance, 
* how to generate setter/getters
* how to add missing imports
* how to format space for before and after {}..etc

### Learn at least one productive, high-level programming language
### Get familiar with unix shell
### Prefer keyboard over the mouse
### Automate your manual workflows
For instance get the tools for you when you change your static file, like css it
will automatically load it in your dev server locally.

### Test out ideas on an interactive interpreter
For instance, some online javascript interpreter can help you quickly 
test out an expression.

### Make it fast and easy to run just the unit tests that associated with your code change.
Any integration tests connecting to a remote server and runs for hours is insane.
Mocking test should be provide to message the flow your code logic to test out
not only the different senarios but also the exception case.
