## Possible Error Solution

* if mention about Java, check JAVA_HOME path, and version, java10 is not supported. [how to change java version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21964709/how-to-set-or-change-the-default-java-jdk-version-on-os-x)
* if mention about port being used, open process manager to kill java process and try again. 
* if everything fails, try mvn clean and build again.

## Create a db user for development
Throughtout the whole project, developer is going to connect to their own local db but in the configuration file
we have to change the user password and user name all the time, so for the convinience, we decided to set a dummy user account
called `mockingtest`, password: `mockingtest`. The following script will help you create such db user in your 
local db, and grant permissiosn.

`
CREATE USER 'mockingtest'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mockingtest';
`

`
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'mockingtest'@'localhost';
